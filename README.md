# Inconsistent Error Handling in Asynchronous Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js: inconsistent error handling in asynchronous operations.  The server randomly simulates success or failure, highlighting the risk of silent failures in production environments.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file shows a simple HTTP server that simulates an asynchronous operation.  The operation might succeed or fail randomly.  In case of failure, the server sends a 500 status code, but there is no robust error handling. This leads to inconsistent behavior and potential silent failures, making debugging more difficult.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a better solution implementing proper error handling. It uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during asynchronous operations, logging the errors appropriately and responding to the client with relevant error messages.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the inconsistent error handling.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
